# 07 Canvas ARPG

This project is a basis for ARPG such as *Pok√©mon* or *The Legend Of Zelda*. The viewport is centered on the character and a canvas handle the full redraw of tiles, animations and so on.

## Description

The player can move. Yup, thats it !

## Implementation

This game is based on my previous work using a full vanilla JS renderer.

## Control

Move with the arrow keys.

## Improvements

There is no game yet !
